# GAN_fMRI_data_generation

This project was made for Machine Learning in Signal Processing course offered in IISc in Spring sem. The purpuse is to generate fMRI data from existing fMRI data using Generative Adversial Networks(GANs). The GANs used has been implemented by keras library in python and uses Dense Neural Networks
